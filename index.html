      Hello! My name is Sean Hamrick. I was born in Florida and moved to Washington when I was just only 2 years old. I have a passion for technology and love to explore new advancements in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing games, and spending time with my family and friends. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="gamelist">
          My favorite games as of late are:
          <ul>
            <li>The FINALS</li>
            <li>Satisfactory</li>
            <li>Crusader Kings III</li>
            <li>Rust</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
         Most people haven't even heard of The FINALS yet, but it's a really fun game that I highly recommend checking out!

         Here's a link to one of my favorite trailers for The FINALS: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1TnHMf_M3g">The FINALS Season 9 Trailer</a>
      </p>
      <p> The customization options in The FINALS are amazing! You can really make your character stand out with all the different skins and accessories available. Here's what I look like in game:</p>
